#### Installation: 
    ```  
To use this program, navigate to the folder in terminal and initiate the program using node index.js
    ```
#### Usage:
    ```  
Initiate the program using node index.js in the terminal. From there the application will ask a series of questions, such as Project title, Description, app usage, how to install, license, contributors, tests, questions, and other. The user will answer each question and the program will use the information to generate a myREADME.md file. The file can then be opened in VS code and copied to the user's Github ReadME file and once copied into the user's GitHub readME the file will generate a professional Readme that can be saved to GitHub.
